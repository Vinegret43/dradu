The goal of this project is to make a FOSS virtual tabletop tool which is able
to run both natively and in browser - make a better replacement for those
proprietary and laggy VTTs.

**Current state**: this project is SO raw it's not even usable, however, this
should change in 3-4 months or so. The main reason for uploading this to GH is
just to have a code backup and be able to work on this from different machines.
You really shouldn't look into this repo right now, but maybe after some time
this project will actually be worth something.
